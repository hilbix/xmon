Changes made to xmon.

==============================================================================

4 September 1990
Initial release of xmon to comp.sources.x Volume 9, Issue 15-19.

==============================================================================

10 September 1990
Patch 1 released to comp.sources.x Volume 9, Issue 30.

  Long lines in the Imakefile were folded by the news software.

  It should now compile on SYSV.  You'll need to use -DSYSV.

  It should now compile on machines that allow more than 128 open
  files.

==============================================================================

8 October 1990
Patch 2 released to comp.sources.x Volume 9, Issue 75.

  Synthetic events (events sent by XSendEvent) are handled correctly.

  There was a bug in version 1 when a client exited.

  Byte swapping is now handled correctly.

  Some minor code clean up.

==============================================================================

13 November 1990
Patch 3 released to comp.sources.x Volume 10, Issue 70.

  The number of bytes in each network protocol packet can be
  displayed.

  Can initialize xmond from a setup file.  (Useful for testing
  clients.)

  Synthetic events are monitored correctly.

  The default server is taken from the DISPLAY environment variable.

  Don't need to use -Bstatic compiler flag on Suns.

  Xmond doesn't need to link to Xt or Xaw libraries.

  Will now compile on Sony's RISC based 3710 system under SVR4.

  Manual page updated to reflect above changes.

==============================================================================

3 October 1990
Patchlevel 4 sent to MIT for inclusion in X11R5 contrib tape.

  More rigorous socket handling.

  Can use numerical network address as display name.

==============================================================================

9 January 1996
Release of version 1.4

  Released to ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/devel_tools/xmon.1.4.tar.gz
    because X11R5 contrib tape was getting hard to find untarred.

  Moved to version numbering scheme rather than patchlevel.

  Removed all X libs from xmond build.

==============================================================================

26 February 1996.
Release of version 1.5

  Added CHANGES file.

  HPUX gets MaxFD the same way as SVR4.  (David Thompson)

  Solaris requires <sys/filio.h> to get FIONBIO, FIONCLEX, etc. 
  (David Thompson)

  Moved x11.h and common.h into xmond.h to fix problems with ordering
  of x11.h and xmond.h.  (David Thompson)

  Redefined references to bzero, bcopy and index for SVR4 to make
  Solaris happy.  (David Thompson)

  Fixed bugs where xmond did not handle long requests or replies. 
  (Mike Tozer)

  Fixed various cast problems found by lint.

  Added support for counting extended requests, errors and events.

  Added ability to print raw bytes and optionally not perform any other
    analysis of messages.

  Added ability to show the number of bytes in each packet received.

  Now prints number of buffered bytes on EOF.

  Sequence number now prints in hex.

  Fixed printing of GetModifierMapping reply.

  Fixed output for PolyText which contains font-shifts.

  Fixed bug with long PutImage requests.

  Removed useless signal catching.

  Made unfinished attempt at event record and playback.

==============================================================================

1 March 1996
Release of version 1.5.1

  Fixed mallocs in widgeti.c and xmonui.c.  Forgot to add 1 for '\0'!. 
  Purified xmond and xmonui and found no more memory problems.  (Marty
  Leisner)

==============================================================================

10 March 1996

  Added Makefile.std to help those without imake. (David Denholm)

20 March 1996

  Fixes for setsockopt() under linux. (Marty Leisner)

  Removed weird continuation lines caused many years ago when I
  submitted the source to comp.sources.x and the lines were wrapped by
  the mailer.  It caused lots of problems!  On Marty Leisner's
  prompting, I have removed all remaining traces.  Another bit of
  net.history fades away.

  Fixed bug when select() returns both client and server file
  descriptors in the same call and the first one processed has EOF. 
  Both file descriptors are closed and their input handlers are set to
  NULL.  In the old code, the NULL input handler was called for the
  second file descriptor.

  Fixed freed memory access bug in CloseConnection when uning -debug
  option.

  Fixed bug in processing of -server option.

  Port numbers are now allowed to be negative, indicating that the
  port number is not relative to 6000.  The real port number is the
  absolute value of the number.

  Added -ascii option.

  Added note about security and "xhost +" to manual page.

30 March 1996

  Added note about event recording and playback to manual page.

==============================================================================

30 March 1996
Release of version 1.5.2

==============================================================================

9 April 1996

  Fixed bug printing sequence numbers when xmond runs on a big-endian machine
  and the client runs on a little-endian machine. (David Denholm)

  Sequence numbers are always printed in hex, even when reporting unknown
  extended requests or unexpected replies. (David Denholm)

  Unexpected replies and unknown extended messages are dumped in hex
  if the error verbose level is "hex".  (David Denholm)

  Fixed bug in PrintString8 and PrintString16 when length of string
  was too large to fit into a short integer.

==============================================================================

9 April 1996
Release of version 1.5.3

==============================================================================

10 April 1996

  Fixed bug in calls to PrintENUMERATED in decode11.c when running on
  a big-endian machine with a little-endian client. (David Denholm)

5 February 1997
  Added delay when replaying events so that replay is more real-time
  rather than sped up.  Also included a copy of usleep.c for those
  whose C library does not contain it.  (Marc Vertes)

  Fixed Imakefile to avoid creating install.man targets for manuals
  that don't exist and to use cc on aix.  Fixed include files for aix. 
  (Noel Hunt)

  Fixed bug in PrintString16() and PrintTextList16() where xmon
  incorrectly assumed the length field in the request was in bytes
  rather than double-byte characters.  (Richard Verhoeven)

  Fixed some problems with the prototypes using the Sun SC 4.0
  compiler. Also fixed several ANSI usage compiler warnings. (Reg Beardsley)

  Standard output is now flushed regularly so that output to a viewer
  such as xless will not lag.

  Modified PrintString8() to split long strings over several lines. 
  This means that a long X Resource string returned by GetProperty
  does not appear on one line (xless can not handle it). 

  Fixed bug in ReplayEvent() under SVR4 where it called memcpy()
  instead of memmove() and thus corrupting playback buffer.

==============================================================================

7 February 1997
Release of version 1.5.4

==============================================================================

2 May 1997
  Added ftp site information to README file. (suggested by David Denholm)

  Fixed bug in PrintINT16() and PrintINT8() in file prtype.c when
  displaying negative numbers, such as event-x and event-y fields in
  MotionNotify events.  (David Denholm)

11 May 1997
  Fixed bug in DecodeEvent() when called from PrintEVENTFORM().  A
  null pointer (Server *) was being dereferenced.  (Peter Cupit)

29 August 1999
  Fixed bug in prtype.c where littleEndian was declared int rather
  than Bool. (Andrew Morrow)

==============================================================================

29 August 1999
Release of version 1.5.5

==============================================================================


3 February 2000
  Fixed bug in main.c where it called setsockopt without an option.
  (Mattias Engdegard)

==============================================================================

3 February 2000
Release of version 1.5.6

==============================================================================
